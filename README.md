| Drama school and college are outside the block | Notes: 1. Drama school is outside the block 2. the gaps between the agora and fountain can be roads leading to other parts of the city 3. Some more appeal may be needed around the edges, especially on higher diffulty levels * This block is very flexible, you can stretch it so that the inner housing part is for example 6×3 houses, or 5×4, or… The block has been tested up to 7×7, and it’s fairly stable at that size (although food delivery problems can arise then) | Notes: The pieces of road are to provide the housing with road access as they don’t touch the inner loop Watch the food supply! This block is stretching the food vendor’s limits. |
